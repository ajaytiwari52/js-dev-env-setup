# Setup Vanila JS Environment Manually
I worked with Angular with webpack, gulp and grunt. I have used angular cli for scaffholding. I was curious if I can create a build for
vanilla javascript with webpack. You can learn more about webpack [here](https://webpack.js.org/). I have used babel for transpiling [ES6](https://babeljs.io/).
